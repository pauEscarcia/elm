# Elm For Beginners
**Elm is a functional language that compiles to JavaScript.** It competes with projects like React as a tool for creating websites and web apps. Elm has a very strong emphasis on simplicity, ease-of-use, and quality tooling.

###Why a functional language?
Forget what you have heard about functional programming. Fancy words, weird ideas, bad tooling. Barf. Elm is about:

* No runtime errors in practice. No `null`. No `undefined` is not a function.
* Friendly error messages that help you add features more quickly.
* Well-architected code that stays well-architected as your app grows.
* Automatically enforced semantic versioning for all Elm packages.

No combination of JS libraries can ever give you this, yet it is all free and easy in Elm. Now these nice things are only possible because Elm builds upon 40+ years of work on typed functional languages.
